# My Project
Schedule A Meeting

# What is a BOT
A bot is a automated software application that is programmed to do certain tasksby running according to their 
instructions without a human user needing to start them up.
Bots can do tasks much faster than humans could.

# Objective Of Our Bot 
This is a bot which helps you to schedule a meeting with a person.
Here, in this code our bot helps our teachers to set a meet with their faculty members like Heads of different departments,
Senior lecturers,Junior lecturers.
I simply used functions for different kinds of faculty they want to choose.

# Further On

send a notification to the faculty members that they have been appointed to a meet with a perticular sir at a perticular time.
